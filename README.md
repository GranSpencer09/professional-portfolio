## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.
Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a
  homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to
find what they need.

- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step
description of how to get the development environment running.

    1. Navigate to the code repository
    2. Press the green code button, located near the about section
    3. Copy either the HTTPS, Git CLI, download the zip, open with GitHub desktop, or copy the SSH link.
    4. Depending on download method, use Git, executable, or the desktop application to open the content files.
    5. All of the content of the repository will be available after completion of the previous state.

## Usage

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators
with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other
developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need
help choosing a license, refer to

[https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let
other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges
hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they
all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to
contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor
Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but
you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples
on how to run them here.
